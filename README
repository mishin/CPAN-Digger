Mirror CPAN (?) Done by rsync:
/usr/bin/rsync -av --delete ftp.funet.fi::CPAN /opt/cpan


Index CPAN:
   save the results in the database and ceate static pages
   - unzip file if it is not yet unzipped
   - update database with the following information
     distro:
       name: Dist-Name
       author: <pauseid>
       modules: list of .pm files in lib/  (later also deal with pm files in root)
   - generate html file from pod

Search:
  allow users to search in the database


Server Layout:

/dist/Dist-Name/      <- collected information about the most recent version of the distribution
/dist/Dist-Name/pod/  <- The POD in HTML format
/dist/Dist-Name/src/  <- The source in HTML format with syntax highlighting
    (links to real source lead to the /src/<pauseid>/Dist-Name-1.02/ structure)

/id/<pauseid>/       <- collected information about the author
/id/<pauseid>/Dist-Name-1.02/     <- The POD in HTML format

/src/<pauseid>/Dist-Name-1.02/    <- source code in plain text format (this is where we unzip the files)

/pod/                 <- the documentation of the most recent perl in HTML marked up format
/pod/perl_5_10_01/    <- the documentation of specific versions of perl in HTML marked up formate (Later)

/q                    <- send queries here


robots.txt

set noindex on /id/pauseid/*  (but allow indexing /id/pauseid/ itself)
set noindex on /src/
set noindex on /pod/perl_5_10_01/ and similar


TODO
- get rid of the lib:: pretag on the dist page
- list the full dependency hierarchy
- 'license analysys' list the licenses of all the dependencies
- replace plain CGI code with Dancer
- allow the user to see the common dependencies
- --ppi run the ppi processor on the files
- add links to previous release
- check why are several versions of the same package processed (eg. Padre)
