Providing a deep view to the CPAN Perl packages
or for any application written in Perl.

WARNING: This is a very early version of the application.
Most of the planned things won't work.

The package contains both the tools to process 
and index the Perl code and the web interface
for it.

It is designed to be able to handle 
- a single perl script 
- a Perl application that lives in a directory tree
- a mirror of CPAN


Platforms:
The application is being developer on Linux and Windows
at the same time so it *should* work on both of them.



SETUP
=======
Mirroring CPAN is done externally.
For example by rsync:
/usr/bin/rsync -av --delete ftp.funet.fi::CPAN /opt/cpan


perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

There is no need to run "make install"


Scripts in the scripts/  directory
=====================================
cpan_digger.pl            - temporary script to load the web application, probably needs refactoring
cpan_digger_index.pl      - indexing CPAN tree or directory tree

cpan_digger_pod2html.pl   - process a single perl (or .pod) file to generate HTML
                            this is mostly used for development
cpan_digger_ppi.pl        - process a single perl file with ppi
                            this is mostly used for development


========================================
Index CPAN:
   save the results in the database and ceate static pages
   - unzip file if it is not yet unzipped
   - update database with the following information
     distro:
       name: Dist-Name
       author: <pauseid>
       modules: list of .pm files in lib/  (later also deal with pm files in root)
   - generate html file from pod

Search:
  allow users to search in the database


Server Layout:

/dist/Dist-Name/      <- collected information about the most recent version of the distribution
/dist/Dist-Name/pod/  <- The POD in HTML format
/dist/Dist-Name/src/  <- The source in HTML format with syntax highlighting
    (links to real source lead to the /src/<pauseid>/Dist-Name-1.02/ structure)

/id/<pauseid>/       <- collected information about the author
/id/<pauseid>/Dist-Name-1.02/     <- The POD in HTML format

/src/<pauseid>/Dist-Name-1.02/    <- source code in plain text format (this is where we unzip the files)

/pod/                 <- the documentation of the most recent perl in HTML marked up format
/pod/perl_5_10_01/    <- the documentation of specific versions of perl in HTML marked up formate (Later)

/q                    <- send queries here


robots.txt

set noindex on /id/pauseid/*  (but allow indexing /id/pauseid/ itself)
set noindex on /src/
set noindex on /pod/perl_5_10_01/ and similar


TODO
- list the full dependency hierarchy
- 'license analyzis' list the licenses of all the dependencies
- replace plain CGI code with Dancer
- allow the user to see the common dependencies of two packages
- allow the user to create all the dependencies of a list of packages and then see "what if I add this extra package?" 
- --ppi run the ppi processor on the files
- check why are several versions of the same package processed (eg. Padre)
- List all the licenses that were used in META files and list all the packages with the given license. List all packages without license
- check if a module is pure_perl or not


- dist page:
  - download link should be based on a configurable cpan server
  - date of release
  - add cpan faces: http://hexten.net/cpan-faces/
  - add links to previous releases (see search.cpan.org)
  - fetch and display number of bugs from RT (and explain why it is not there if the bugtracking is different)
  - Other tools (grep and later diff between versions)
  - fetch data from CPAN Testers and display PASS (146)   NA (1)   UNKNOWN (70)
  - Rating: fetch data from CPANRATINGS and display the stars and the number of reviews
  - For modules, fetch the one-line description and the version number from each one and display them
  - Annotate POD - fetch the number of annotations and display the counter

Be able to index
  1) CPAN or local CPAN with injected files
  2) @INC of current perl
  3) list of directories (e.g. for the @INC of some other perl or file of
     a project in a version control system)
